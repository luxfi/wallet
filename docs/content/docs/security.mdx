# Security

Security is paramount for a cryptocurrency wallet. This document covers security best practices and the security architecture of Lux Wallet.

## User Security Guidelines

### Seed Phrase Protection

- **Never share** your seed phrase with anyone
- **Never enter** your seed phrase on websites or apps you don't trust
- **Store offline** - write it down on paper, never digitally
- **Use multiple backups** stored in separate secure locations

### Transaction Safety

- Always **verify recipient addresses** before sending
- **Double-check amounts** before confirming transactions
- Be aware of **gas fees** and network conditions
- Use **hardware wallets** for large holdings

### Account Security

- Use a **strong password** for wallet encryption
- Enable **biometric authentication** where available
- Keep your device **software updated**
- Avoid using wallet on **public or shared devices**

## Security Architecture

### Key Management

```

Encrypted Storage
```

### Encryption

- Keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Password-based key derivation using Argon2
- Secure random number generation from platform CSPRNG

### Secure Storage

| Platform | Storage Method |
|----------|----------------|
| iOS | Keychain Services |
| Android | Android Keystore |
| Desktop | Encrypted file with OS keyring |
| Web | IndexedDB with encryption |
