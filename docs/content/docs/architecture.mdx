```

## Application Targets

### Web Application

The web application uses Next.js with React for a responsive web wallet experience.

**Key Technologies:**
- Next.js for SSR and routing
- React for UI components
- Web3 libraries for blockchain interaction

### Desktop Application

Desktop builds use Electron to package the web application as native desktop apps.

**Platforms:**
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Windows (x64)
- Linux (AppImage, Snap)

### Mobile Applications

Mobile apps are built with React Native for cross-platform native experience.

**Platforms:**
- iOS (iPhone and iPad)
- Android (Phone and Tablet)

### Browser Extension

The browser extension supports multiple browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Brave

## Core Packages

### packages/core

Core wallet functionality:
- Key management and derivation
- Transaction building and signing
- Chain-specific logic
- State management

### packages/ui

Shared UI components:
- Design system components
- Common layouts
- Reusable patterns

### packages/sdk

SDK utilities:
- API clients
- Helper functions
- Type definitions

## State Management

The wallet uses a centralized state management approach with:
- Local state for UI components
- Global state for wallet data
- Persistent storage for settings and accounts

## Security Architecture

### Key Storage

- Keys are encrypted at rest
- Hardware wallet integration for cold storage
- Secure enclave usage on supported devices

### Transaction Signing

- All signing happens locally
- Clear transaction preview before signing
- Support for hardware wallet signing

## Build System

The monorepo uses:
- Yarn workspaces for package management
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest for testing
